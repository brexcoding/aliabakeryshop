the problem of the space in the db might be solved by automating the sending to another platform ---> google drive maybe or anything else
  i just need to find a way to connect it to the db
 as a backup solution if something went wrong

its important to add the functionalty of adding morre products to the menu 

means i need 2 db tables one for posting the products
                                 and one as a form when clients order the products


start with the landing page ... maybe bring what i have and tweek it 
after that code a function for the items ... make a template . and make sure to see if you can add a posting functionality 

moving to the order page  i need to create a form ..table ---> name .. numberphone .. quantity .. adress ....and need to find a way to add the item name without making the user writing it

---------------------------------------- delevery info   --------------------------------------
product id ------ 
quantity  ------ integerfield
name of the store
location of the store
name 
phone number
